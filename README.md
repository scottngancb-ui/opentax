**[opentax.filed.com](https://opentax.filed.com)** - Fully open-source federal tax calculation engine. Single binary. Runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

> **Note:** This engine calculates taxes accurately for use by AI agents and developers. For filing your taxes, visit [irs.gov](https://irs.gov).

Built and maintained by AI agents using official IRS publications as the sole source of truth.

> Covers Form 1040 (TY2025) today. Additional forms and state returns coming.

## Why

- Professional tax calculation engines are closed source, expensive, and built for humans — making it hard for AI agents to reliably use one as a calculator
- AI agents have drastically reduced the cost of building and maintaining a tax engine. It only makes sense to do it in the open
- This project aims to be the first truly open-source, up-to-date tax calculation engine that works for everyone

**Designed for the AI era:**

- Built to be run by AI agents more than humans
- Single binary CLI that AI agents can download and run instantly
- Everything stored locally. Open, secure, and accessible

Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's [autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch), an autonomous loop where AI agents modify code, measure results, and keep only improvements. OpenTax applies the same idea to tax calculation: agents read IRS instructions, write implementations, generate test cases, and fix regressions in a continuous loop.

## Example: single W-2 filer

```bash
$ opentax return create --year 2025
{ "returnId": "a1b2c3" }

$ opentax form add --returnId a1b2c3 --node_type general '{"filing_status": "single"}'
{ "id": "general_01", "nodeType": "general" }

$ opentax form add --returnId a1b2c3 --node_type w2 '{"box1_wages": 55000, "box2_fed_withheld": 5200}'
{ "id": "w2_01", "nodeType": "w2" }

$ opentax return get --returnId a1b2c3
```

```json
{
  "returnId": "a1b2c3",
  "year": 2025,
  "summary": {
    "line1z_total_wages": 55000,
    "line9_total_income": 55000,
    "line11_agi": 55000,
    "line15_taxable_income": 39250,
    "line24_total_tax": 4471.5,
    "line33_total_payments": 5200,
    "line35a_refund": 728.5
  },
  "lines": {
    "filing_status": "single",
    "line1a_wages": 55000,
    "line12a_standard_deduction": 15750,
    "line15_taxable_income": 39250,
    "line16_income_tax": 4471.5,
    "line24_total_tax": 4471.5,
    "line25a_w2_withheld": 5200,
    "line33_total_payments": 5200,
    "line34_overpayment": 728.5,
    "line35a_refund": 728.5
  }
}
```

$55,000 in wages, $15,750 standard deduction, $39,250 taxable income, $4,471.50 tax, $728.50 refund. Every line traces back to the IRS instructions.

## Calculation, review, export and filing are different stages

The catalog currently exposes federal Form 1040 for TY2025. Registered nodes do
not prove complete coverage of every tax situation, other tax years or states.
`return get` is useful for partial calculations and diagnostics; inspect its
warnings before relying on amounts. `return validate` checks implemented MeF
business rules, not all tax law or IRS acceptance criteria.

Normal PDF/MeF export blocks on every executor diagnostic, even with `--force`.
`--force` overrides only reject-severity business rules. It is not a calculation
repair or evidence that a return is ready to file. Existing callers that used
`--force` to export incomplete calculations must now opt into `--draft`.

For diagnostic review, use `--draft` (and `--force` separately if business rules
reject). Every draft XML includes a DRAFT/INCOMPLETE comment; every draft PDF is
watermarked on each page. Draft mode does not guarantee that malformed data can
be rendered. Successful non-draft API return types remain XML text or a PDF path.
The new `ExportExecutionError` exposes executor entries separately from
`ExportRejectedError`. Shell redirection may create an empty file on failure;
check the command exit status, not just file existence.

CLI export does not perform XSD validation. Optional developer XSD tests need
the separate IRS schema bundle and skip when it is absent. The CLI has no
transmission or acknowledgement retrieval command. Signatures, authorized
transmission, applicable IRS testing/identifiers, state coverage and acceptance
handling must be established separately. Export is neither filing nor acceptance;
these facts do not establish any commercial product's IRS authorization.

The CLI stores returns locally. Uploading source documents into a hosted
assistant is a separate disclosure to that provider, not local-only processing.

## More commands

```bash
# Validate against IRS MeF business rules
opentax return validate --returnId a1b2c3

# Export as IRS MeF XML for downstream validation or transmitter workflows.
# This does not transmit a return or prove IRS acceptance.
opentax return export --returnId a1b2c3 --type mef > return.xml

# Write an interactive page showing how every line was derived
opentax return explore --returnId a1b2c3            # -> .state/returns/a1b2c3/explore.html
opentax return explore --case benchmark/cases/f1040/2025/05-single-w2-interest-income

# List entries in a return
opentax form list --returnId a1b2c3

# Update or delete a form entry
opentax form update --returnId a1b2c3 --entryId w2_01 '{"box1_wages": 60000, "box2_fed_withheld": 5800}'
opentax form delete --returnId a1b2c3 --entryId w2_01

# Inspect what fields a node expects
opentax node inspect --node_type w2

# List all registered nodes
opentax node list
```

## Staying up to date

OpenTax tells you when a new version is available:

```
$ opentax return get --returnId abc-123
{ ... }

Update available: 0.1.0 → 0.2.0. Run `opentax update` to upgrade.
```

To update:

```bash
opentax update
```

That's it. The binary replaces itself with the latest release.

Check your current version anytime:

```bash
opentax version
```

## Supported forms (TY2025)

131 input nodes covering the full range of 1040 source documents: W-2s, 1099s, all major schedules, credits, capital transactions, and more.

See [`catalog.ts`](catalog.ts) for the complete list of supported nodes and their schemas. Or from the CLI:

```bash
opentax node list
```

---

## How it's built

The engine is a directed graph of **nodes**. Each node is a pure function: validated input in, typed output out. No state, no side effects.

- Schemas defined with Zod, types inferred (never duplicated)
- Immutable data throughout, no mutation anywhere
- Type-safe output routing between nodes enforced at compile time
- 133 real-world benchmark scenarios

AI agents maintain the codebase:

- Read IRS instructions
- Write node implementations
- Generate test cases from official IRS exercises
- Fix regressions

All traced back to the authoritative IRS source.

## Development

Requires [Deno](https://deno.land).

```bash
# Run tests
deno task test

# Run accuracy benchmark
deno task bench

# Run the CLI in dev mode
deno task tax return create --year 2025
```

### Contributing with Claude Code

The repo includes four skills that automate the full development lifecycle. Open the project in [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and invoke them with `/skill-name`.

#### `/tax-status`

Run this first. Shows pass/fail counts, pending root causes, and build phase for every form.

```
/tax-status
```

#### `/tax-fix [form:year]`

Autonomous bug-fixing loop. Reads failing benchmark cases, clusters them by root cause, spawns parallel fixer agents, validates, and commits any net-positive improvements. Loops until all cases pass or progress stalls.

```
/tax-fix f1040:2025
```

#### `/tax-cases [source]`

Sources test cases from IRS publications (VITA exercises, Pub 17, MeF test packages). Run `/tax-fix` after to see how the engine performs on the new cases.

```
/tax-cases vita                            # VITA Pub 4491 training exercises
/tax-cases pub17                           # Publication 17 worked examples
/tax-cases "senior with SSA and 1099-R"    # free-form scenario
```

#### `/tax-build [form-number]`

End-to-end form builder. Researches IRS instructions, extracts ground truth, builds all nodes section by section, then runs a validate + fix loop until >= 95% of benchmark cases pass. Resumes if interrupted.

```
/tax-build 1120
```

#### Typical workflows

**Adding a new form:**

```
/tax-cases f1120:2025 vita    # source benchmark cases first
/tax-build 1120               # build nodes, iterate until >= 95% pass
/tax-status                   # confirm it's green
```

**Fixing a regression:**

```
/tax-status                   # find what's failing and why
/tax-fix f1040:2025           # autonomous fix loop
```

**Expanding test coverage:**

```
/tax-cases pub17              # pull new IRS examples
/tax-fix f1040:2025           # fix loop against expanded case set
```
